# 0.2.0 2015-30-05

This is a community-made update, implemented things from the reddit thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/37r1v2/hey_guys_im_a_dm_and_ive_needed_a_simple/).

## Added

+ Notes

  Added the ability to add notes to each entity.

## Changed

+ Healing/damaging

  Instead of having the health increment or decrement by one, you now add in the amount you want to heal or damage, and press the corresponding button.

+ Adding entities usability improvements

  Adding entities now works as a form, so you can choose next/previous on mobile, and on a computer you can just press enter to submit.
